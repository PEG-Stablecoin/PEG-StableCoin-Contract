# PEG Stable Coin

This repository contains the source code of the PEG Stablecoin Ethereum smart contract.

It is currently in the form of a [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) project.

This smart contract is able to function entirely by itself, but it is designed to be use in conjunction with the [PEG Stable Coin](https://pegstablecoin.com) website by end users seeking an intuitive interface.

This contract was written by [Ciarán Ó hAoláin](https://cohaolain.ie) as part of his Thesis project submitted as part of his B.Sc. Computational Thinking, in collaboration with his supervisor [Dr. Phil Maguire](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/people/phil-maguire).
